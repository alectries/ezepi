ezepi (short for Easy Epidemiology) is a package that simplifies the calculation of common epidemiological measures of occurrence and association from pre-existing datasets. ezepi is built using the tidyverse and fmsb.

## How to install

Run the following commands in your R console to install ezepi:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alectries/ezepi")
```

All versions are currently experimental, so you do not need to specify a branch or version.

You can update ezepi by running `update_packages()` and selecting the option for ezepi.

## Basic use

All ezepi functions follow a basic format:

```
ezepi_function(
  x,              # the dataset to analyze
  exposure_var,   # the categorical exposure variable
  outcome_var,    # the categorical (binary) outcome variable
  person_time,    # the variable noting observation's contributed person-time
  index_exp,      # the value of exposure_var that represents an exposed observation
  ref_exp,        # the value of exposure_var that represents an unexposed observation
  index_out,      # the value of outcome_var that represents a realized outcome
  ref_out,        # the value of outcome_var that represents an unrealized outcome
  conf_lvl        # the confidence level
)
```

Not all of these arguments are used in every function, and many values have defaults. For instance, `person_time` is only included when the function calculates a rate, rate difference, or rate ratio. Additionally, many arguments have default values and do not need to be specified every time: `ref_exp` defaults to 0, and only needs to be set if the referent exposure value is not 0.

ezepi is written to support piping. You can perform data management functions on a dataset before piping it into ezepi without problems.

## Functions

ezepi includes two main types of functions: "ez" functions and "more" functions.

### ez functions

ez functions are used when comparing a binary outcome across a single exposed (or treated, or index) group and a single unexposed (or untreated, or referent) group. Thus, ez functions require you to specify `index_exp`. ez functions include:

1. **ezprev**: Generates a table with counts and prevalence of a specified outcome.
2. **eztbl**: Generates a table with counts, totals, and risks of the specified outcome according to exposure status.
3. **ezir**: Generates a table with case counts, total person-time, and rates of the specified outcome according to exposure status.
4. **ezrd**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for a risk difference.
5. **ezrr**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for a risk ratio.
6. **ezior**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for an incidence odds ratio.
7. **ezird**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for an incidence rate difference.
8. **ezirr**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for an indicence rate ratio.

Most ez functions generate a tibble, which can be piped into `View()` or tidyverse functions to extract needed data.

### more functions

In contrast to ez functions, more functions are used to compare a binary outcome across multiple exposure categories. The exposure variable is assumed to be disjoint. more functions do *not* require you to specify `index_exp`, because all values of `exposure_var` other than `ref_exp` will be considered treatment groups. more functions include:

1. **moretbl**: Generates a table with counts, totals, and risks of the specified outcome according to exposure category.
2. **morerd**: Generates a table with counts, totals, risks, risk differences, and a CI for each exposed group compared with the unexposed group.
3. **morerr**: Generates a table with counts, totals, risks, risk ratios, and a CI for each exposed group compared with the unexposed group.
4. **moreior**: Generates a table with counts, totals, risks, incidence odds ratios, and a CI for each exposed group compared with the unexposed group.
5. **moreprev**: Generates a table with counts and prevalence for each outcome group.

Currently, there is no more function for incidence rate association measures. This is due to some perplexing issues with fmsb that are still being sorted out.

### Miscellaneous functions

These functions are useful for general data management.

1. **ezt**: Transposes (flips the rows and columns of) a dataframe. Similar in function to `t`, except it can retain headers more easily.
2. **mutate_rows**: A wrapper for `dplyr::mutate` that allows you to generate row data based on existing rows. It uses `mutate` under the hood, so the arguments are the same.

### Features in development

- **Cleanup/reorganization:** The current priority is to reorganize the source code to make use of subfunctions that are easier to tweak and upgrade. Some savvy users may recognize this as good coding practice, but I am young and naïve, so I'm just now figuring that out.
- **Better errors:** Once the source is reorganized, I'll update error messages to use rlang (i.e. `abort()`) instead of base R (i.e. `stop()`) to report errors.

### Possible future features

- **Naming:** Set names of exposure and outcome variables to be output
  into a table.
- **GLMs**: I would like to add support for easy modeling, but this is a longer-term initiative.
- **Graphing**: Specifically boxplots for existing more functions and charts for GLMs.

### GitHub issues

Please make use of issues to point out bugs, unexpected or unclear errors, or suggest new features. ezepi is being actively developed, and I am interested in useful improvements.
