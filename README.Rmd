ezepi (short for Easy Epidemiology) is a package that simplifies the calculation of common epidemiological measures of occurrence and association from pre-existing datasets. ezepi is built using the tidyverse and fmsb.

This branch (main) is an active rewrite of ezepi. Download the latest release (v1.0.0) to use a functioning (but not perfect) version of ezepi.
