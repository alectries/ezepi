# ezepi

ezepi (short for Easy Epidemiology) is a package that simplifies the calculation of common epidemiological measures of occurrence and association from pre-existing datasets, allowing you to get various epi measures from line-list data without wrangling it first. Most ezepi functions are wrappers of fmsb.

# How to Install

Run the following commands in your R console to install ezepi:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alectries/ezepi@v2.0.1")
```

You can update ezepi by running `devtools::update_packages()` and selecting the option for ezepi.

## Basic use

Most ezepi functions follow a basic format:

```
ezepi_function(
  x,              # the dataset to analyze
  exposure_var,   # the categorical exposure variable
  outcome_var,    # the categorical (binary) outcome variable
  person_time,    # the variable noting observation's contributed person-time
  index_exp,      # the value of exposure_var that represents an exposed observation
  ref_exp,        # the value of exposure_var that represents an unexposed observation
  index_out,      # the value of outcome_var that represents a realized outcome
  ref_out,        # the value of outcome_var that represents an unrealized outcome
  conf_lvl        # the confidence level
)
```

Not all of these arguments are used in every function, and many values have defaults. For instance, `person_time` is only included when the function calculates a rate, rate difference, or rate ratio. Additionally, many arguments have default values and do not need to be specified every time: `ref_exp` defaults to 0, and only needs to be set if the referent exposure value is not 0.

ezepi is written to support piping. You can perform data management functions on a dataset before piping it into ezepi without problems.

## Functions

ezepi includes two main types of functions: "ez" functions and "more" functions.

### ez functions

ez functions are used when comparing a binary outcome across a single exposed (or treated, or index) group and a single unexposed (or untreated, or referent) group. Thus, ez functions require you to specify `index_exp`. ez functions include:

1. **ezprev**: Generates a table with counts and prevalence of a specified outcome.
2. **eztbl**: Generates a table with counts, totals, and risks (or odds) of the specified outcome according to exposure status.
3. **ezir**: Generates a table with case counts, total person-time, and rates of the specified outcome according to exposure status.
4. **ezrd**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for a risk difference.
5. **ezrr**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for a risk ratio.
6. **ezior**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for an incidence odds ratio.
7. **ezird**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for an incidence rate difference.
8. **ezirr**: Generates a table with an estimate, CI, and p-value for an indicence rate ratio.

Most ez functions generate a tibble, which can be piped into `View()` or tidyverse functions to extract needed data.

### more functions

In contrast to ez functions, more functions are used to compare a binary outcome across multiple exposure categories. The exposure variable is assumed to be disjoint. more functions do *not* require you to specify `index_exp`, because all values of `exposure_var` other than `ref_exp` will be considered treatment groups and compared to `ref_exp`. more functions include:

1. **moreprev** Generates a table with prevalences of a specified outcome.
2. **moretbl**: Generates a table with counts, totals, and risks (or odds) of the specified outcome according to exposure category.
3. **moreir**: Generates a table with case counts, total person-time, and rates of the specified outcome according to exposure category.
4. **morerd**: Generates a table with risk differences, CIs, and p-values for each exposed group compared with the unexposed group.
5. **morerr**: Generates a table with risk ratios, CIs, and p-values for each exposed group compared with the unexposed group.
6. **moreior**: Generates a table with incidence odds ratios, CIs, and p-values for each exposed group compared with the unexposed group.
7. **moreird** Generates a table with incidence rate differences, CIs, and p-values for each exposed group compared with the unexposed group.
8. **moreirr** Generates a table with incidence rate ratios, CIs, and p-values for each exposed group compared with the unexposed group.

### Utility functions

ezepi also includes utility functions that make certain data wrangling tasks easier.

1. **ezt**: An alternative to `base::t()`. Transposes tables but without as many errors and hangups.
2. **mutate_rows**: A wrapper for `dplyr::mutate()` that transposes a table, implements typical mutate arguments, and transposes it again, which allows you to add rows to data as though they were columns.

## Development status

This package is now in stable condition.

### Coming changes

- Recreate sanity checking with rlang.
